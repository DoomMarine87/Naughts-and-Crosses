# Noughts-and-Crosses
A noughts and crosses game written in the Python language

This is my first Python project.

The user can play a game of noughts and crosses with a computerised opponent. 

To play the game run NoughtsAndCrosses.py.

This is a work in progress.  The code relating to the game options selected by the user (e.g. the selection of the difficulty levels needs to be refactored
and potentially stored in another script which can then be imported in NaughtsAndCrosses.py)

An additional option to allow the player to choose whether they go first or second maybe be added as well as potentially adding a two player game mode.
