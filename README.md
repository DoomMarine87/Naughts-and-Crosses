# Noughts-and-Crosses
A noughts and crosses game written in the Python language

This is my first Python project.

The user can play a game of noughts and crosses with a computerised opponent. 

To play the game run NoughtsAndCrosses.py.

The board consists of a 3x3 array.  So when selecting your move you will have to type the index of of the array on which you want to insert your 'X' or '0'.  For instance if you wanted to place your choice in the the first slot in the grid (the top left) you would input "0,0".  The next slot in the grid would be "0,1" (top middle).  If you wanted to select the middle space in the grid your selection would be "1,1".  The last square on the grid (bottom right) is "2,2".   The first digit represents the row and the second digit represents the column.  Both of these digits must be separeted by a comma.

This is a work in progress.  The code relating to the game options selected by the user (e.g. the selection of the difficulty levels needs to be refactored
and potentially stored in another script which can then be imported in NaughtsAndCrosses.py)

An additional option to allow the player to choose whether they go first or second maybe be added as well as potentially adding a two player game mode.
